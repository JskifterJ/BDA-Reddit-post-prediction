&gt;This year's Nobel Prize is awarded to three scientists who have made a decisive contribution to the fight against blood-borne hepatitis, a major global health problem that causes cirrhosis and liver cancer in people around the world.  
&gt;  
&gt;Harvey J. Alter, Michael Houghton and Charles M. Rice made seminal discoveries that led to the identification of a novel virus, Hepatitis C virus. Prior to their work, the discovery of the Hepatitis A and B viruses had been critical steps forward, but the majority of blood-borne hepatitis cases remained unexplained. The discovery of Hepatitis C virus revealed the cause of the remaining cases of chronic hepatitis and made possible blood tests and new medicines that have saved millions of lives.",Breaking News,60,6,38

&gt;Three Laureates share this year’s Nobel Prize in Physics for their discoveries about one of the most exotic phenomena in the universe, the black hole. Roger Penrose showed that the general theory of relativity leads to the formation of black holes. Reinhard Genzel and Andrea Ghez discovered that an invisible and extremely heavy object governs the orbits of stars at the centre of our galaxy. A supermassive black hole is the only currently known explanation.",Breaking News,279,4,249

While [extremely rare](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/10/what-massive-database-retracted-papers-reveals-about-science-publishing-s-death-penalty), retractions are an important mechanism for validating the peer review process and correcting the scientific literature. As the largest source of science news on Reddit, we want to properly inform our readers about retracted studies they may have seen.

In the event a previous submission to r/science has been retracted, please [notify the moderators via Modmail](https://www.reddit.com/message/compose?to=%2Fr%2Fscience&amp;subject=Retraction). The following actions will be taken:

1. The submission's flair text will be updated with ""RETRACTED""
2. If the submission is not yet archived, a stickied comment will be made providing details about the retraction and link to the journal's announcement.
3. At the discretion of the moderation team, a stickied post announcing the retraction will be made to permit discussion. These will primarily be reserved for recent retractions and/or submissions that garnered significant attention on Reddit. The standard subreddit commenting rules will apply, so overly conspiratorial or antagonistic comments will be removed.

If you have any questions about this policy, feel free to inquire below in the comments or via Modmail.

**Reddit Submission:** [Microsoft and Niels Bohr Institute confident they found the key to creating a quantum computer. They published a paper in the journal Nature outlining the progress they had made in isolating the Majorana particle, which will lead to a much more stable qubit than the methods their rivals are using.](https://www.reddit.com/r/science/comments/88i5eq/microsoft_and_niels_bohr_institute_confident_they/)

The article ""[Quantized Majorana conductance](https://doi.org/10.1038/nature26142)"" has [been retracted](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-021-03373-x) from *Nature* as of March 8, 2021. Concerns were raised after [inconsistencies in figures were identified](https://twitter.com/spinespresso/status/1357111565242220545) after the raw data was shared with outside researchers Sergey Frolov and Vincent Mourik. A re-analysis found that the data had been ""unnecessarily corrected"" without explanation and no longer resulted in the claimed observation of the Majorana fermion. The authors requested a retraction from *Nature* last year, who issued an [Editorial Expression of Concern](https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-2252-6) to initiate the retraction process. The authors have recently released [a new manuscript](https://arxiv.org/abs/2101.11456) with corrected and extended datasets to replace the original publication and discuss the broader implications of their updated observations.
